# nightingale

Nightingale is a React Native app to display jokes from the Internet Chuck Norris Database.

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org), [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app), and [Expo](https://expo.io).

### Project

Nightingale can be run by installing Expo from the App Store or Google Play Store, and entering `https://exp.host/@donny/nightingale` as the project URL. The app gets the jokes from the [Internet Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com). It has two tabs: `Linus Torvalds` for tech jokes and `Chuck Norris` for non-tech jokes. New jokes can be fetched by tapping the joke text. The iOS and Android screenshots can be seen below:
